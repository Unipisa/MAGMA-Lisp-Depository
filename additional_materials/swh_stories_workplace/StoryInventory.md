# Story moments - a first attempt (revised)

*Wikidata items to be created are identified as Q\*xxx, for later reference inside this document. Once created, all references should be replaced with the actual Qid.*

*In the statements, braces are used to pair the name-Pid and value of a property. The same holds for the fields of an uploaded image or video, iFrames, etc.*

## Timeline moment

*DESIDERATA*

Here are the dates of the first and last versions of the codes:

* PER: 13/2/68, 15/2/68 (hand written on the only printout)
* LETT: 13/2/68, 21/3/68 (hand written on the only printout)
* Exec: 5/3/68
* Exec: 5/3/68 (with output)
* Exec: 4/4/68
* Exec: 29/3/68
* SW_NAME-1: no date
* SW_NAME-2: 13/2/68, 5/3/68
* SW_NAME-3: 9/3/68, 4/4/68

*Question: I used inception P571 to indicate the initial date of the time span of the creation of SW_NAME. How do I enter the final date of the time span? I see that Kat has used P2669 discontinued date). I'm afraid both properties do not convey the intended meaning, that is the time span covered by our findings, which is likely shorter than the time span of the project.*

*Question: we might also put here the dates when they were saved in SWH. Again, do we need a new property?*

*Question: should we put also Guido, Laura and myself as collectors and curators? Or it is too narcissitic? (Guido says no - Having got a better understanding I think not)*
