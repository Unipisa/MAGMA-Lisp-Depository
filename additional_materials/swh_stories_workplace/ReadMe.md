The images, videos, documents, etc. to be put in the story should be collected here, divided per *moment*, according to the sub-folder structure.

An entry should be added to the [StoryInventory](StoryInventory.md) file for each added item, with the information nedeed to insure that the item is satisfactorily self documenting, once uploaded in the appropriate Wikimedia data base. Care should be taken that each item can be granted a pubblic domain license, as required by the Wikimedia policies.

Auxiliary materials should be stored in the other_materials folder.
