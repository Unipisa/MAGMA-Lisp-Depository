# SW_NAME People moments

### This folder provides storage for the images, videos, documents, etc. related to the people involved in the SW_NAME software project. 

The people story moments fall in two classes, with a dedicated sub-folder each: *media_gallery*, for images and videos, and *library*, for documents.

An entry should be added to the [StoryInventory](https://github.com/Unipisa/SW_NAME-Workbench/blob/structure_review/additional-materials/swh_stories_workplace/StoryInventory.md) file for each added item, following the pattern offered in the dedicated section.

Please refer to the [SWHAP@Pisa](https://github.com/SoftwareHeritage/swhapguide/blob/master/SWHAP%40Pisa.pdf#CreateaSWH-story) guidelines for greater details.
