- Folder [raw materials](./raw_materials) holds the original materials, as they have been found or submitted.

- Folder [browsable source](./browsable_source) holds a browsable version of the source code, recovered from the source files, made accessible through the GitHub web interface, by transcribing the images resulting from digitizing the original computer printouts.

[Information on the acquisition process](https://github.com/Unipisa/SW_NAME-Workbench/tree/master/metadata) can be found in the [Workbench](https://github.com/Unipisa/SW_NAME-Workbench).
