# MAGMA-Lisp Workbench

### This [SWHAPPE](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) workbench is for the acquisition of the source code of MAGMA-Lisp, an extended Lisp interpreter for non-deterministic programming, developed at the Istituto di Scienze dell'Informazione (ISI) of the University of Pisa in the nineteen seventies.

This workbench comes with a few folders to support the process.

- Folder [raw materials](./raw_materials) is for the original materials, as they have been found or submitted.

- Folder [browsable source](./browsable_source) is for a browsable version of the source code. Source files, with right extention, have to be accessible through the GitHub web interface, e.g., archives should be decompressed, images should be transcribed, etc.

- Folder [source](./source) is for the curated revision of the source code, as a base for the recontruction of the development history as a git repository, i.e., a folder for each major version of the code.

- Folder [metadata](./metadata) holds various files with meta information used throughout the process. 

- Folder [additional materials](./additional_materials) is for materials originated during the recovery process to document it or to shed new light on the recovered software project.

- Folder [.swhap](./.swhap) holds the templates of the README files of the various repositories created in the process.

Please look at the [SWHAPPE repository](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE/blob/master/README.md) and the [guidelines](https://github.com/SoftwareHeritage/swhapguide/blob/master/SWHAP%40Pisa.pdf)  for more details.
